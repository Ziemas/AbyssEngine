# Abyss Engine

Official Abyss Engine documentation.

## Overview

Abyss Engine is an ARPG engine used to create games similar to games like Diablo 2. 
Think RPG Maker, but for isometric ARPGs.

Games written in this engine are called mods, which are developed via lua scripts and files/archives.
Mods can utilize the original MPQ file archives seen in Diablo 2 games, as well as local file systems 
(and eventually other packaged types as well), in addition to raw filesystem files.
